# wd201-Node.js-Applications
# As part of my capstone project, I built a Node.js application called sports-sch2 (Sports-Schedular).

This application aids in both the creation of sports by administrators and the creation of sports sessions by participants and also admins. Players and administrators can both join in the sports sessions that have been organised.
